# Unit testing

To run any unit tests, you want to navigate to the relevant folder and simply run `main` with, and this is **important**,
the `-ea` VM option to enable assertions.

Since this isn't a maven project I don't have access to real unit testing frameworks like junit, so raw assertions must
be manually enabled.
